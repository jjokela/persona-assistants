**Scenario: AI-Powered Content Discovery Platform**
    You are leading the development of an AI-powered content discovery platform that uses machine learning to provide personalized content recommendations to users. The platform analyzes user interactions, content metadata, and user-generated content to create a unique profile for each user, represented by embeddings. These embeddings are high-dimensional vectors that capture user preferences and content features.
    The platform needs to store and retrieve large volumes of data, including user profiles, content metadata, embeddings, and interaction logs. The data storage solution must support efficient querying for real-time recommendations and be capable of scaling as the number of users and content items grows.

**Information Provided:**
- Embeddings are updated frequently as user preferences and content change.
- Real-time recommendation queries need to be fast and efficient.
- The system should be able to handle a mix of structured data (e.g., user demographics) and unstructured data (e.g., text content, interaction logs).
- The platform is expected to start with a moderate user base but will need to scale to potentially millions of users and content items.
- The development team has experience with various database technologies but is open to adopting new solutions if they provide significant advantages.
